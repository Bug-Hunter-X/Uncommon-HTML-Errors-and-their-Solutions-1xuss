# Uncommon HTML Errors and Their Solutions

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors that can occur in HTML and provides solutions for fixing them.

The `bug.html` file showcases the errors, and the `bugSolution.html` demonstrates the solutions.

## Errors:

*   **Accessing a non-existent attribute:** Attempts to retrieve the value of a non-existent attribute using `getAttribute()`. This can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled properly.
*   **Incorrect use of `innerHTML`:**  Demonstrates errors that might occur when using `innerHTML`, including incorrect closing tags and invalid HTML structure. 
*   **Missing closing tags:** Shows the issues caused by missing closing tags which can lead to unexpected rendering or errors.
*   **Incorrect nesting of elements:** Shows the result of incorrect nesting of HTML elements which could create invalid HTML.

## Solutions:

The `bugSolution.html` file corrects the errors. The solutions are focused on using valid and well-structured HTML and carefully handling potential errors. It shows how to properly use `innerHTML`, ensure elements are properly closed and nested, and check for the existence of attributes before accessing them.
